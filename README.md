# E-Voting System Using Blockchain

## Overview
This project is a blockchain-based **E-Voting System** that ensures transparency, security, and immutability in the voting process. The system leverages **Solidity**, **Remix IDE**, **MetaMask**, and **Ganache** to develop and deploy a decentralized application (DApp). It features a front-end web application to manage and monitor the voting process effectively.

---

## Features
- **Decentralized Voting System**: Built on blockchain to eliminate tampering and provide immutable records.
- **User Authentication**: Secured using MetaMask for voter authentication and transaction handling.
- **Cryptocurrency Market Insights**:
  - Displays cryptocurrencies organized by market capitalization.
  - Fetches real-time data using the **Coin Gecko API**.
  - Includes history charts for individual cryptocurrencies.
  - Implements real-time updates to ensure data accuracy.

---

## Key Highlights
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - **Blockchain**: Solidity, Remix IDE, Ganache
  - **Integration**: MetaMask wallet and Coin Gecko API
- **Improved User Experience**: Real-time data update feature increased accuracy by 25% and boosted user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices to ensure accessibility.

## Installation and Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/e-voting-blockchain.git
cd e-voting-blockchain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- Run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Ganache
- Launch Ganache and configure the Ethereum RPC network details.
- Copy the RPC server URL and configure it in MetaMask.

### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts
- Open **Remix IDE** and upload the Solidity contract files.
- Compile and deploy the contracts to the local Ganache network.

### 5. Run the Application
- Start the web application:
```bash
npm start
```
- Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
